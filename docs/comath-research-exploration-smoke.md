# Co-Math Research Exploration Smoke

Run from a clean folder:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/comath-research-demo
mkdir -p /tmp/comath-research-demo
cd /tmp/comath-research-demo
/home/hermes/developer/pi-mono-comath/pi-test.sh comath --approve
```

Then enter:

```text
Explore this problem:
Are there infinitely many primes of the form n^2 + 1?
```

Then:

```text
summarize current state
```

```text
focus on counterexamples
```

```text
drop the direct proof path
```

```text
try a weaker theorem
```

```text
continue
```

Success criteria:

```text
[ ] Pi creates multiple research paths.
[ ] User input is visible in the main Pi interface.
[ ] Product copy says path/research, not role-run/workstream/queue.
[ ] User can focus on counterexamples.
[ ] User can abandon a path.
[ ] User can ask for a summary.
[ ] Existing validation flow still works in a separate clean folder.
```
